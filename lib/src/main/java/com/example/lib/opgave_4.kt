//Get an LLM (ChatGPT, Deepseek, etc) to solve the following exercise two times. One as a junior developer, one as a senior developer.
//Describe the differences in the the two solutions. What solution do you prefer? Are there concepts you dont understand. If so learn them and explain them.
//Create 2 classes Circle & Triangle with a parent class: Shape.
//Every shape has two attributes
//
//color
//isTransparent
//Furthermore every class has private attributes to calculate perimeter and area for each shape.
//E.g. a Rectangle has the attributes: height, width, color & isTransparent
//
//The attributes are set in the constructor
//The 2 classes all overrides the following abstract methods from their parent class:
//
//calculatePermeter
//calculateArea
//The functions will return the permeter or area of the shape.
